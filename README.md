# Pioneer-MRX-5-Battery
swap out the MRX-5s Li-Ion battery pack


I bought a used Pioneer MRX-5 from a private ebay-reseller.
All 3 lights were flashing blue, all I could find in the manual was something like 'contact your dealer'.
Since the unit was sold without invoice, my guess was it was older than 2 years when i bough it (2023) and so i figured Pioneer was not going to be a big help, since the MRX-5 is discontinued and my experience with their customer service was not the best a few years ago.

So my first guess was just to slap in the name or model number on ebay, aliexpress ot just google.
Pretty much no matching results. next attempt was to just google for a solution, but it seems like Pioneer did not sell a lot of theese units to people who like to mend things (like I do).

So I tore the thing apart, looking for the battery. Turns out it even has a battery pack they could easily replace. Not user-servicable, but it can be done without breaking anything.
Next I googled again for what it said on the battery pack:

Model: 18650-3S1P-01B02226T
Voltage: 10,8V
Capacity: 220aAh/23,76Wh
MFD.: 2017.05
RED WIRE:+   BLACK WIRE:-
3ICR19/65
Mfr.: Dongguan Large Electronics Co., Ltd

Again, no matching result. Some results look the same but do not match perfectly.
I also noticed the cells had a little backpack containing some electronics, I guess for charging, since Li-Ion cells do not like just beaing charged for what I know.
